# hello-world
This is a hello-world my first exploration in using Git
today the message at church was really good. I ned grace to remember all of the key content. God should speak to me throughout the week on the message and I should feel saturated with his love
I also was able to fix the repeater in far end bedroom
was able to raise a call with spark regarding the broadband and the issue seems to be fixed now
